Open Distro is an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of software that includes open source Elasticsearch and Kibana packaged with a number of feature-adding plugins built by AWS. The open source Elasticsearch and Kibana portions of the distribution come from the upstream downloadable artifacts ranging from versions 6.5.4 to 7.10.2. These Elasticsearch and Kibana artifacts are not forks and the current maintenance policy for upstream Elasticsearch outlines that the most recent minor release for the current major version and the most recent minor release of the previous major version will be maintained.

**Open source Elasticsearch and Kibana 7.10.2 reached their end of life on May 11th, 2022, and are no longer receiving active development, security patches, or bugfixes. Because of this, the Open Distro project is archived.**

Because of this, we strongly recommend that anyone who uses Open Distro migrate to OpenSearch where we can make critical updates to the search engine and dashboard code bases. For more information about migrating from Open Distro to OpenSearch see [the documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/upgrade-to/index/).
